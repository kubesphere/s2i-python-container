{#
    This file has to be manually generated via `pipenv lock` for every
    new Python version. Just take Pipfile, generate Pipfile.lock and copy
    it to src/test/pipenv-test-app/<python_version>/Pipfile.lock.
    It's then included here â†“ when Pipfile.lock is generated by distgen.

    Steps:
    1. Go to examples/pipenv-test-app
    2. Update Pipfile - change Python version to the new one
    3. Run `pipenv lock`
    4. Copy Pipfile.lock to src/test/pipenv-test-app/<new_python_version>/Pipfile.lock

{% include "src/test/pipenv-test-app/" + spec.version + "/Pipfile.lock" %}
